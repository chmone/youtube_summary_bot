# General Coding Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication â€“ check for existing functions before writing new ones.
- Make sure code is clean and minimal, with no unnecessary complexity.
- Refactor when files are over 300 lines.
- Do not use mock data for development or production environments. Only use it for testing.
- Ensure that all files and functions are modular, easy to read, and maintainable.

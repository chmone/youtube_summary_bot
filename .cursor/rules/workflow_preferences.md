# Workflow Preferences

- Always focus on the task at hand. Do not introduce unrelated changes or features.
- Only change code that is directly relevant to the requested task.
- Write tests for every new feature or modification.
- Avoid changing the project structure unless explicitly required.
- Always keep the codebase clean and well-organized, and delete unnecessary scripts after execution.

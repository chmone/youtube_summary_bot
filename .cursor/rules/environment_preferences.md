# Environment Preferences

- Ensure separate configurations for Development, Test, and Production environments.
- Only use local configurations in development (e.g., SQLite for local development).
- For testing, mock data can be used, but ensure tests are based on real, functional data.
- Do not modify production database schemas without prior validation and testing.

# Workflow Preferences

- Always focus on the task at hand. Do not introduce unrelated changes or features.
- Only change code that is directly relevant to the requested task.
- Write tests for every new feature or modification.
- Avoid changing the project structure unless explicitly required.
- Always keep the codebase clean and well-organized, and delete unnecessary scripts after execution.

# Environment Preferences

- Ensure separate configurations for Development, Test, and Production environments.
- Only use local configurations in development (e.g., SQLite for local development).
- For testing, mock data can be used, but ensure tests are based on real, functional data.
- Do not modify production database schemas without prior validation and testing.

# General Coding Preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Avoid duplication â€“ check for existing functions before writing new ones.
- Make sure code is clean and minimal, with no unnecessary complexity.
- Refactor when files are over 300 lines.
- Do not use mock data for development or production environments. Only use it for testing.
- Ensure that all files and functions are modular, easy to read, and maintainable.
